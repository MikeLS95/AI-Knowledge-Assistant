# AI Knowledge Assistant

## Overview

AI Knowledge Assistant is a Ruby on Rails web application that allows users to upload documents and interact with an AI chatbot that answers questions based on those documents.

This project is part of my personal development roadmap to build a production-ready AI-powered knowledge management tool.  
It’s also a foundation for future business applications and hobby use cases (like AI-assisted wiki chat).
